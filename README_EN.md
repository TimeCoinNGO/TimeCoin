This idea has been formed for a long time:it is necessary to make a top-level design for the future human currency. This idea has been formed for a long time. Here is a brief summary. The first point of view here is that it is impossible to let RMB go the old way of US dollar. The hegemony of a single country's currency is the product of the development of human culture to a certain stage, Human beings have learned enough lessons from the hegemony of the US dollar (the former pound has not yet formed the influence of the US dollar). Under the condition that mankind has reached a consensus, the RMB version of Bretton Woods system and the RMB version of petrodollars will not appear again


There are two paradoxes of monetary hegemony in a single country. The first is Triffin's paradox, that is, to supply money to other countries, the deficit must be maintained. The second is the ternary paradox (Mundell triangle), that is, the independence of domestic currency, the stability of exchange rate and the complete liquidity of capital can not be realized at the same time (there are other derivative descriptions)

The non objectivity of a single country's currency. Every time I see the statistics of a country's gdpxxx US dollars, there is a sense of absurdity. The US dollar is always inflationary. Look at the historical data of M2 of the US dollar. Who can guarantee that the US dollar will not become the next Zimbabwean dollar

The U.S. dollar hegemony reflects the anti human characteristics. A group exploits the interests of other groups with a cost-free currency. Behind the seemingly innocent high consumption of every American, they bear the original sin

In this case, leaving aside the present monetary system, what characteristics should an ideal currency have



Objective monetary subject cannot be limited by human ability and nature

Inflation money must maintain growth, because human wealth is growing. First of all, if monetary tightening will lead to insufficient liquidity, the traditional economic theory is enough to explain. Second, there are also human factors. The maintenance of assets will magnify human inertia, which is not much developed

Taking these two points as an example, it is clear enough to exclude the US dollar. Secondly, excluding bitcoin, the total amount of bitcoin is limited. That is to say, bitcoin is a naturally tight currency, and everyone is waiting for appreciation, which can not help the economy. Secondly, the limitations of bitcoin include two aspects (technology and energy), quantum computing, and the earth can support energy, Finally, excluding oil, these also include gold (here refers to the currency issued by the way of quantity linked), which is limited by the earth's resources and even unable to maintain stability in the next 20 years, which can not be used as a measure of currency



Therefore, I propose a new currency, time currency, that is, a currency with circulation linked to time. Time is inherently objective and inflationary. First of all, there will be some scientific hypotheses or scientific fantasies. But when human beings can manipulate time, they should also master the ultimate meaning of the universe. The significance of money itself may not exist, or it is beyond recognition, At least at the present stage, time is objective, and our currency can also be issued according to the location of the earth. The second is inflation. Time is always moving forward and never stops. In the scale of the physical world, except entropy, there is no one that has been growing in one direction and cannot be negative



Finally, to be specific, we can issue currency (in digital / virtual form) based on the length of time up to now. We can set up a global organization to implement it. We can modify the monetary model for specific implementation problems
